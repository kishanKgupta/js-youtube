//The for loop is typically used when the number of
// iterations is known or can be determined in advance.

//The while loop is used when the number of iterations is
// not known in advance, and the loop continues as long as
// a specified condition is true

while(condition)
{
    //body
    //update
}

//In a while loop, the condition is evaluated before the loop
//body is executed. If the condition is initially false, the
//loop body may never execute.

do{
    //body
}(condition);

//In a do-while loop, the condition is evaluated after the loop body is executed. This guarantees
//that the loop body will be executed at least once, even if the condition is initially false.
